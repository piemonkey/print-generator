# Print media generator

A quick project to allow easy generation of things for print using common artwork and fonts hosted on Github pages or similar. Thrown together for Extinction Rebellion but should generalise pretty easily for anything else.

# Rights

Font included is of unknown copyright but is readily available online anyway.

The extinction symbol is used from http://www.extinctionsymbol.info/ and is strictly for non-commercial use.
